# USCthesis

**USCthesis** provides a LaTeX style package for writing your thesis,
dissertation, or thesis proposal at the University of Southern
California (USC), based on the [USC Graduate School Thesis and
Dissertation Formatting Guidelines][usc-thesis-guidelines].

This style has floated around and evolved informally across students and
departments. See the [other templates](#other-templates) that exist for
other versions.
